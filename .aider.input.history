# 2024-11-08 04:18:47.556299
+Awesome love it! Alright lets create the page when one of the catagories is clicked. I want it to look pretty much the same. Lets start with brands. Once brand is click it will go to a new page with the heading being Marcas Populares, and then a grid of brands which will be layed out the same as the main catagories. So the only brands I need right now are AROY D, KIKKOMAN, and KUM CHUM LKK, COCK, and ROSE.

# 2024-11-08 04:35:37.149110
+Awesome, looks perfect! Lets get into the products now for the brands. Product are listed below:
+
+	Brand	Quantity/Weight
+Leche de coco	AROY D	2.9L
+Curry verde	AROY D	1KG
+Curry rojo	AROY D	1KG
+Curry amarillo	AROY D	1KG
+Curry panang	AROY D	1KG
+Curry massaman	AROY D	1KG
+Rice stick / tallarín de arroz 5MM	ROSE	375G
+Rice stick / tallarín de arroz 10MM	ROSE	375G
+Pasta de chili con aceite de soya "Prik Pao"	COCK	3KG
+Sweet chili salsa	AROY D	920G
+Papel arroz 22cm	AROY D	454G
+Rice vermicelli	ROSE	220G
+Canned bamboo sliced	AROY D	2.95KG
+Salsa soya	KIKKOMAN	18.9L
+Oyster sauce	KUM CHUM LKK	2.27KG

+
+The featured products will be on a gallery slider. which has dots on the botton to show the position on the gallery. I don't think we need any boarder boxes, or hover effects, under the image there will be the brand and catagory the product is under. 
+
+Example: 7-up - Beverage
+
+Then will be the name of the product followed by the unit size. Finnally will be the case size of one order.

+Awesome that should work perfectly. The next step might be a little tricky but I think it should be managable to shift. So what needs to happen is we need to make the comercio routes dynamic in terms of what categories, and brands are displayed. The current layout looks great it should be a matter to querying the data using the server actions for the categories, brands, and products to be mapped out. Where it starts to get challenging is that each categories and brand will need to display a new page with the assiciated products displayed.
