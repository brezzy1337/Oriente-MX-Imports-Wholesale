+Awesome looks great the only thing is that the grid containers a bit to large. do you think we can have smaller like a 3rd of the size?

# 2024-11-08 04:18:47.556299
+Awesome love it! Alright lets create the page when one of the catagories is clicked. I want it to look pretty much the same. Lets start with brands. Once brand is click it will go to a new page with the heading being Marcas Populares, and then a grid of brands which will be layed out the same as the main catagories. So the only brands I need right now are AROY D, KIKKOMAN, and KUM CHUM LKK, COCK, and ROSE.

+Awesome looks perfect! Lets make one more style change I actually want the containers and the grids to be about half the size it is right now and a little bit more of a gap would be nice.

# 2024-11-08 04:35:37.149110

First is about us which has a header of about us, followed by the name of the company, then a discription of the company and what we do which is import products from thailand to mexico. Finally a button that says learn more.
